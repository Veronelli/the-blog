# project-foundation

## Purpose

The project foundation establishes the base Django scaffold, its tooling, and the extensibility contract that lets future capabilities be added as isolated apps without changing core behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Reproducible Python toolchain
The project SHALL declare its Python environment and dependencies explicitly. Dependency management SHALL be handled with `uv`, the project SHALL target Python 3.14, and Django 6.1 SHALL be a declared dependency.

#### Scenario: Environment creation from scratch
- **WHEN** a developer runs `uv sync` in the repository root on a clean checkout
- **THEN** a virtual environment with Python 3.14 and Django 6.1 installed is created and ready to use

### Requirement: Standard Django project structure
The project SHALL provide a runnable Django project package named `the_blog` exposing the standard entry points: `manage.py`, `settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, and `asgi.py`.

#### Scenario: Management commands run
- **WHEN** a developer runs `python manage.py check` from the `the_blog/` directory
- **THEN** Django loads the project configuration and reports that the system is configured without errors

#### Scenario: Server starts
- **WHEN** a developer runs `python manage.py runserver`
- **THEN** the Django development server starts and serves the project

### Requirement: Administrative interface
The system SHALL enable the Django admin interface and expose it at the `/admin/` URL path.

#### Scenario: Admin login page reachable
- **WHEN** a user visits `/admin/` on a running server
- **THEN** the Django admin login page is served

#### Scenario: Superuser access
- **WHEN** an authenticated superuser logs into `/admin/`
- **THEN** they can manage registered models through the admin interface

### Requirement: Development-ready defaults
The system SHALL ship with development-oriented defaults: debug mode enabled, SQLite as the default database, the console email backend, and static files served from a configured `static/` URL.

#### Scenario: Local development run
- **WHEN** a developer runs the development server locally
- **THEN** the server uses the SQLite database, runs with debug mode on, and serves static files under `/static/`

#### Scenario: Email output in development
- **WHEN** the application sends an email while in development
- **THEN** the email is written to the console instead of being delivered to an SMTP server

### Requirement: Extensible application architecture
The system SHALL allow new capabilities — content publishing, LLM integration, payment methods, click trackers, social media, and similar — to be added as isolated Django apps registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`, without requiring changes to the core `the_blog` project package's routing or behavior.

#### Scenario: Adding a new capability as an app
- **WHEN** a new Django app is created and registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`
- **THEN** Django discovers and loads the app, and the existing core project behavior is unchanged

#### Scenario: Isolated URL routing
- **WHEN** a new app defines its own `urls.py` and is included from the project's URL configuration
- **THEN** the app's routes are served under their configured path while existing routes continue to work
